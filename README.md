# Wavy-Enneper-Surface

The **Wavy Enneper Surface** is a variation of the classical **Enneper Surface**, which is a well-known minimal surface in differential geometry. Minimal surfaces are surfaces that locally minimize their area, and they often exhibit interesting geometric properties.

### Classical Enneper Surface
The classical Enneper Surface is defined by the following parametric equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
x = u \cos(v) - \frac{u^3}{3} \cos(3v) \\
y = -u \sin(v) - \frac{u^3}{3} \sin(3v) \\
z = u^2 \cos(2v)
\end{cases}
\]

Here, \( u \) and \( v \) are parameters, and the surface is defined for \( u \in \mathbb{R} \) and \( v \in [0, 2\pi) \). The Enneper Surface is known for its self-intersecting, saddle-like shape.

### Wavy Enneper Surface
The **Wavy Enneper Surface** introduces additional parameters and modifications to the classical Enneper Surface to create a more complex and visually interesting surface. The parametric equations for the Wavy Enneper Surface are:

Here:
- \( u \) and \( v \) are parameters similar to the classical Enneper Surface.
- \( s \) is a parameter that controls the complexity of the surface.
- \( w \) is often used as a time-dependent parameter to introduce animation or wave-like effects.

### Key Features of the Wavy Enneper Surface
1. **Periodic Waviness**: The introduction of the \( w \) parameter (often time-dependent) creates periodic wave-like deformations on the surface, making it more dynamic and visually complex.
2. **Increased Complexity**: The parameter \( s \) allows for more intricate shapes compared to the classical Enneper Surface.
3. **Aesthetic Appeal**: The Wavy Enneper Surface is often used in mathematical visualization and art due to its intricate and aesthetically pleasing patterns.

### Applications
- **Mathematical Visualization**: The Wavy Enneper Surface is used to study minimal surfaces and their properties.
- **Computer Graphics**: It is used in 3D modeling and animation to create visually interesting surfaces.
- **Art and Design**: The surface's intricate patterns make it a popular choice for mathematical art and design.

In summary, the Wavy Enneper Surface is a fascinating extension of the classical Enneper Surface, characterized by its wave-like deformations and increased geometric complexity. It is widely used in both mathematical research and creative applications.
